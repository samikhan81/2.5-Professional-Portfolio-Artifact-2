"Real-Time Object Detection System with Alerting"
Introduction
A live webcam application that identifies objects using YOLOv5 and triggers audio alerts for specific items. Demonstrates edge AI deployment and real-time processing.
Objective
•	Highlight proficiency in real-time computer vision.
•	Showcase end-to-end deployment (Docker) and integration with hardware (webcam).
Process
1.	Model Selection: Chose YOLOv5 for speed/accuracy trade-off.
2.	Alert Logic: Added conditional checks for target objects (e.g., "cell phone").
3.	Deployment: Containerized the app for reproducibility.
Tools & Technologies
•	Python, PyTorch, OpenCV
•	Docker, YOLOv5, pyttsx3
Value Proposition
•	Unique Value: Combines real-time inference with user notifications, mimicking industrial IoT use cases.
•	Relevance: Useful for security systems, retail analytics, or accessibility tools.
